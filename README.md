# Green Solution

This website is made for Vietnam Sach Va Xanh organization. We didn't get the part but here's the website anyways. The website is 100% Vietnamese.

## Demo

[Green Solution](https://green-solution-rmit.web.app/home)

## Getting Started

Go to the client folder and run:

### `npm install` or `npm i`

to install all of the packages needed for this website

## Run

Run this command:

### `npm start`

to start the website. The website should run on http://locahost:8000 on your browser.

## Deployment

This website is deployed with Firebase Hosting and AWS Beanstalk, but the AWS version does not last long because AWS charges quite a lot of money to keep a website running.

To deploy the webiste, first run:

### `npm run build`

to bundle the website, a build folder should be created after the build is done.

Then run:

### `firebase deploy`

to deploy this website to your Firebase Hosting server (I won't cover how to set up one).
